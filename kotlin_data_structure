//Kotlin Input
    println("Enter your name")
    val name = readLine()
    println("Enter your age")
    val age : Int = Integer.valueOf(readLine())
    println("your name is $name and your age is $age")
//Input funcs
    val name = readLine() --- to read string
//for other input other than string
    val read = Scanner(System.`in`)
    var age = read.nextInt() -- to read integer
    println("your input age is $age")
    The other data types Boolean, Float, Long and Double uses nextBoolean(), nextFloat(), nextLong() and nextDouble() to get input from user.
//Comments

//bracket
    we dont need bracket for single line execution in kotlin
//for loop
    val marks = arrayOf(10,20,30,70,50,60)
    for (item in marks)
        println(item)
    //using indices
        val marks = arrayOf(80,85,60,90,70)  
        for(item in marks.indices)  
        println("marks[$item]: "+ marks[item])  
//range
    .. is used to give range
